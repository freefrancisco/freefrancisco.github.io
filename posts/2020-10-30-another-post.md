If mathjax worked this would show up $x + y$ 

and so would this $$ \frac{x}{y} $$

let's see if I can add it...

Now what happens when I do code? 

This haskell code should be highlighted...

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int
f x = 2 * x
```
Same code but without indicating it's haskell...

```
f :: Int -> Int
f x = 2 * x
```

Profit!
